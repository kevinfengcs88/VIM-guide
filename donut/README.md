# Donut

This repository contains a modified version of C code that generates a spinning torus, AKA donut from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/gcr/1075131). I wrote it up using the VIM plugin for VSCode to familiarize myself with some of VIM's basic text editor commands (in fact this README is being written with VIM as well!).

The output looks a little something like this:

It's best if the .exe is ran in a terminal that does not scroll (otherwise the rendered frames of the donut will not "animate" smoothly in the same spot on your screen).
